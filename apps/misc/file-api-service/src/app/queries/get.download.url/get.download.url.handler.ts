/**
 * Handles generation of pre-signed download URLs for secure direct-from-S3 file access operations.
 *
 * **Business Rules:**
 * - Pre-signed URLs provide secure, time-limited access for direct S3 downloads without exposing AWS credentials
 * - Download URLs expire after configurable time period (typically 1-24 hours depending on content sensitivity)
 * - Access control enforced through user permissions and file ownership validation
 * - Download operations logged for audit trail, usage analytics, and compliance reporting
 * - Content-Type headers preserved to ensure proper browser handling and file rendering
 * - Bandwidth usage tracked for cost management and usage pattern analysis
 *
 * **Integration Points:**
 * - AwsS3LibService: AWS S3 SDK integration for pre-signed URL generation and secure file access
 * - Access Control Service: User permission validation and file ownership verification
 * - Audit Logging: Comprehensive download tracking for security, compliance, and analytics
 * - CDN Integration: CloudFront distribution for global file access with edge caching
 * - Usage Analytics: Download metrics, popular content tracking, and user behavior analysis
 *
 * **File Access Categories:**
 * - User Documents: Personal files, uploaded documents, profile assets, private content
 * - Product Resources: Product manuals, specification sheets, documentation, media files
 * - Media Content: Images, videos, audio files, presentations, marketing materials
 * - System Assets: Configuration exports, backup files, generated reports, logs
 * - Shared Content: Public documents, downloadable resources, promotional materials
 * - Archived Data: Historical records, compliance documents, backup archives
 *
 * **Security Considerations:**
 * - Pre-signed URLs contain temporary credentials with read-only access and time expiration
 * - User authorization validated before URL generation to prevent unauthorized access
 * - IP address restrictions can be applied for highly sensitive content downloads
 * - Download attempt logging with user attribution, timestamp, and source IP tracking
 * - Virus scanning verification before allowing download of user-uploaded content
 * - Rate limiting applied to prevent abuse and protect against download flooding
 *
 * **URL Features:**
 * - Content disposition headers: proper filename and download behavior configuration
 * - Cache control optimization: appropriate caching strategies for different content types
 * - Range request support: partial downloads and resume capability for large files
 * - Content encoding: automatic compression and optimization for supported file types
 * - Metadata preservation: original upload information and file properties maintained
 *
 *
 * **Error Scenarios:**
 * - File not found: Returns 404 with file availability status and alternative suggestions
 * - Access denied: Returns 403 with permission requirements and access request procedures
 * - File corrupted: Returns 500 with integrity check results and recovery options
 * - S3 service unavailable: Returns 503 with retry guidance and mirror availability
 * - Bandwidth exceeded: Returns 429 with rate limit information and retry timing
 * - File expired: Returns 410 with archival status and recovery procedures
 *
 * **Use Cases:**
 * - Document Sharing: Secure document distribution, report downloads, file sharing
 * - Media Delivery: Image serving, video streaming, audio file distribution
 * - Data Export: System exports, backup downloads, data portability requests
 * - Product Distribution: Software downloads, documentation access, resource libraries
 * - Content Delivery: Marketing materials, educational resources, public downloads
 * - Archive Access: Historical data retrieval, compliance document access, backup restoration
 *
 * **Download Analytics:**
 * - Usage tracking: download counts, popular files, user engagement metrics
 * - Performance monitoring: download speeds, success rates, error patterns
 * - Geographic analysis: download patterns by region, CDN effectiveness
 * - Security monitoring: suspicious download patterns, potential abuse detection
 * - Cost optimization: bandwidth usage analysis, storage tier recommendations
